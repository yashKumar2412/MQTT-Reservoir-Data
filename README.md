# MQTT-Reservoir-Data
As part of my Enterprise Distributed Systems course, I implemented a simple application to demonstrate the pub-sub model using MQTT with multiple publishers and one subscriber. I used reservoir water level data from three reservoirs and published it to each individual topic, consumed by a single subscriber application listening on all 3 topics. Having collected the data, it generates a report and time-series visualization for the same.

The report for this can be found in the MQTT Reservoir Data Assignment Report file.
